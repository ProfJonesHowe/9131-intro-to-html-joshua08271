<h1>How a Cyberattack almost Controlled the Internet</h1>
  <h2>How the Attack worked</h2>
<p>In early 2024 a hacker posing as a person working to help create a tool for linux imbeded a backdoor slowly over a long period of time. The tool was incredibly close to being pushed out for use, before a single man noticed the software was pulling more processing power than it should have been. The attack was set up to implicate China but it is believed it originated from Russia</p>
  <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
<p>Had the attack been sucessful it would have potentially spread to millions of systems, compromising numerous confidential and important documents systems to penetration.</p>
